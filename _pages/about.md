----------------

I am a data-driven computational biologist and data scientist, specializing in **bioinformatics** and **translational research**. I recently earned my **PhD in Computer Science and Informatics** from Emory University , where my research focused on translating large, complex molecular data into actionable insights to advance cancer care. I enjoy managing complex quantitative projects from start to finish and have a proven track record of delivering novel solutions for therapeutic target identification and disease characterization.

As a doctoral researcher in the Bhasin Systems Biomedicine Lab (2021-2025), I led and contributed to several high-impact projects.

* I integrated scRNA-seq datasets from various sources to develop pediatric leukemia single-cell atlas. Performed transcriptomic analysis and validation to identify 9 genes dysregulated in leukemia and over-expressed at diagnosis in AML, ALL, and MPAL.
* I led the development of "CAR-Machine," a Python-based platform that streamlines R&D by automating the identification and assessment of high-potential cell therapy targets from high-throughput genomic data.
* I also built "PedSCAtlas," an interactive data visualization dashboard (using Plotly Dash) to make complex pediatric cancer data accessible and explorable for clinicians and non-technical stakeholders.
* My work also involved building and validating predictive models, including optimizing a deep ensemble method for protein expression prediction and validating a 7-gene SVM classifier for accurately identifying malignant cancer cells from single-cell data.

I am passionate about using my skills in data science, machine learning, and statistical analysis  to solve complex problems and make a real-world impact. As a recent graduate, I am actively seeking new opportunities to apply my expertise to advance computational biology and cancer research.

### Education

I graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology with a **BSc in Biomedical Engineering** in December 2020. I then began my PhD in Computer Science and Informatics at Emory University in August 2021 and earned an **MSc** when I became a PhD candidate in May 2024. I recently completed my defense, and graduated with a **PhD in Computer Science and Informatics** in November 2025.
