----------------

I am a data-driven and analytical CS PhD candidate at Emory University, specializing in **Data Science** and **Bioinformatics**. My passion lies in translating large, complex datasets into actionable insights and developing interactive tools to empower decision-making. I enjoy the challenge of managing complex quantitative projects from start to finish and have a proven track record of delivering novel solutions for target identification and disease characterization.

Since January 2021, I have been a graduate researcher in the Bhasin Systems Biomedicine Lab, where I have had the opportunity to lead and contribute to a number of exciting projects. I led the development of "CAR-Machine," a Python platform that streamlines R&D by automating the identification of high-potential cell therapy targets from complex genomic data. I have also built "PedSCAtlas," an interactive dashboard to make complex pediatric cancer data accessible and explorable for non-technical users. My work has also involved building and validating predictive models, such as a 7-gene SVM classifier for identifying malignant cancer cells.

I am passionate about using my skills in data science, machine learning, and programming to solve complex problems and make a real-world impact. I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, and I am excited to see what the future holds.

### Education

I graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology with a BSc in Biomedical Engineering in December 2020. I then began my PhD in Computer Science and Informatics at Emory University in August 2021 and earned an MSc when I became a PhD candidate in May 2024.
