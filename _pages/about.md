I am PhD Candidate at Emory University, in the Computer Science and Informatics - Biomedical Informatics program. I have been a researcher in the [Bhasin Systems Biomedicine Lab](https://bhasinlab.org/) since January 2021, joining after graduating from Georgia Tech with a BSc in biomedical engineering in December 2020. I started the Computer Science and Informatics PhD program, with a concentration in [Biomedical Informatics](https://med.emory.edu/departments/biomedical-informatics/index.html), in August 2021.

Background
======
I grew up in Dacula, Georgia and went to Buford High School. After high school, I moved to Atlanta in 2016 to attend Georgia Tech, then moved to Decatur when I began my graduate school program at Emory. My interest in computer science and data analysis began during my time at Georgia Tech, when I found I was more interested in the coding portion of my studies rather than the hands-on engineering courses. After my third year of undergrad, I wanted to try something new and applied for multiple internships related to biomedical data analysis. I spent the summer of 2019 at a medical startup in Mountain View, CA and was tasked with developing a bioinformatics pipeline for their human sequencing data - this was my first introduction to bioinformatics - and found I really enjoyed the hybrid nature of the field, where I got to utilize my knowledge of biology and statistics/computer science methods from my courses. When I got back to Atlanta, I searched for research labs at Emory and Georgia Tech that utilized bioinformatics to study diseases. 

I worked as an undergraduate researched at the Jo Lab from 2019 to 2020, where I assisted with the scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, and lncRNA analysis of endothelial cell reprogramming in the carotid artery. This was my first introduction to academic research, and I had the opportunity to work on their 2020 publication in Cell Reports. Through this experience, I knew I wanted to pursue research further and develop more bioinformatics-specific skills. In the beginning of 2021, I applied to the Emory CSI/BMI PhD program, and sought out to join the Bhasin Lab because of their projects in cancer and development of bioinformatics tools. 

My Research
======
Because of the low prevalence of cancer in children compared to adults, there is historically a lack of publicly available datasets and specific research pertaining to childhood cancer. Multiple large-scale *adult* studies and platforms have been generated that utilize transcriptomic, proteomic, and epigenomic technologies to characterize adult cancer and diseases, such as the **The Cancer Genome Atlas Program** by NCI. However, datasets of this size are not available for pediatric cancers, and pediatric and adult cancers are typically treated as separate entities. 

My research is in **(i)** the *omics* analysis of pediatric cancers to characterize the heterogenetiy within cancer subtypes and to understand the dysregulation at the single-cell level that may lead to the development of these diseases, and **(ii)** the development of and application of bioinformatics tools and methods to facilitate the analysis of large-scale datasets of *pediatric* cancers.
