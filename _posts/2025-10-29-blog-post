I am thrilled to announce that I have successfully defended my PhD in Computer Science and Informatics from Emory University! 

My research focused on devising and implementing novel bioinformatics approaches to map pediatric leukemia at the single-cell level, leading to the identification of new biomarkers and potential drug targets.

This achievement would not have been possible without the incredible support and mentorship of my advisor, Dr. Manoj K. Bhasin, and my committee members: Dr. Tony Pan, Dr. Steve Qin, Dr. Sunil Raikar, and Dr. Xiuwei Zhang. 

I am also deeply grateful to my collaborators and lab mates at the Bhasin Lab, and the Emory University Department of Biomedical Informatics for their support!
