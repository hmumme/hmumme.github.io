I traveled to San Diego to attend the American Society of Hematology annual conference where I present our poster, *CAR-Machine: CAR-T Cell Target Identification Platform for Pediatric Acute Leukemia and Implementation to Identify Novel Targets for Pediatric AML* available at [https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2024-210175](https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2024-210175).
